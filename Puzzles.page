- A pile of 1,000 coins is split into two piles x and y. Multiply those
  together to get a number x*y.

  Subdivide each of the two piles further and get a number for each pile. (Say
  you divide x to get the number x1*x2, and y to get the number y1*y2)

  Repeat the process until there are 1,000 piles, each with 1 coin.

  Add all of the numbers together. What is the sum??

  Does the answer change depending on how you split the pile?

  Bonus question: You have a line segment of length 1. You divide it into two
  pieces x and y to get the number xy. Divide each smaller piece and repeat the
  process. If you add up all the numbers, what is the limit?

- Every man in a village of 100 married couples has cheated on his wife. Every
  wife in the village instantly knows when a man other than her husband has
  cheated, but does not know when her own husband has. The village has a law
  that does not allow for adultery. Any wife who can prove that her husband is
  unfaithful must kill him that very day. The women of the village would never
  disobey this law. One day, the queen of the village visits and announces that
  at least one husband has been unfaithful. What happens?

- if prob of seeing car on highway in 30m is .95, prob of seeing car in 10m?

- Fitch Cheney's 5-card trick:

  The question concerns a "magic trick" involving playing cards, a standard 52-card deck.  There are two magicians, and they are working together.

  The first magician finds a member of the audience and asks them to pick out 5 cards from the deck and hand them back to him.  The magician takes a look at the 5 cards, chooses one of them, and hands it back to the audience member, asking him to look at it and hold on to it.  This is the secret card.

  The first magician then takes the remaining four cards, arranges them in some order and hands them to the second magician, who upon receiving the four cards is able to magically tell everyone what the secret card is!  ** Tada! **

- You have a lighter and two ropes. Each rope burns up in 1 hour from end to
  end, but the ropes do not burn evenly.  How can you measure 45 minutes by
  burning the ropes?  50 minutes?

- A robber broke into the belfry of a church, and though he had nothing to
  assist him but his pocket-knife, he contrived to steal nearly the two lengths
  of the two bell ropes, which passed through holes in the lofty boarded ceiling.
  How did he effect his purpose? Of course, there was no ladder or aught else to
  assist him. It is easy to understand that he might steal one rope and slide
  down the other, but how he cut the two, or any considerable portion of them,
  without a bad fall, is perplexing. (Puzzle by Henry Dudeney.)

Game theory
===========

- dividing pizza: I'll slice, and we'll take turns picking in a circle (only
  adj pieces), you pick first; better to have me odd or even num slices?

- cannibals:

  A traveler gets lost on a deserted island and finds himself surrounded by a
  group of n cannibals.

  Each cannibal wants to eat the traveler but, as each knows, there is a risk.
  A cannibal that attacks and eats the traveler would become tired and
  defenseless. After he eats, he would become an easy target for another
  cannibal (who would also become tired and defenseless after eating).

  The cannibals are all hungry, but they cannot trust each other to cooperate.
  The cannibals happen to be well versed in game theory, so they will think
  before making a move.

  Does the nearest cannibal, or any cannibal in the group, devour the lost
  traveler?

Number theory

General math
============

- in evenland, only even numbers exist.  primes are numbers that cannot be

  a unique prime factorization; in evenland, numbers can have multiple prime
  factorizations.  what's the smallest such number?
- find $x$ if $x^{x^{x^\dots}} = 2$
- find all real/complex roots of $x^6 = 64$

- 3 points randomly drawn on circle; prob of them being on same semi-circle?
- unit length broken off into 3 pieces; prob of forming triangle?
- $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}}$
- You have 5 unknown numbers. There are 10 options in selecting two out of
  these five. Sum each of those two together, thus you have 10 numbers. You're
  given these, find the original 5 numbers.
- Given two vectors $x,y$ of $N$ elements where first $M$ are numbers and
  remaining are letters from an alphabet, want to find:

  `distance(x,y) = l1_distance(x[1..M], y[1..M]) + hamming_distance(x[M+1..N], y[M+1..N])`

  E.g., `hamming_distance([a,b,c], [a,a,c]) = 1`
