Riddles
=======

- how many ways are there to walk up s steps if you can take 1 or 2 at a time?
- given two ropes that burn in 60m (non-uniformly), measure 15m
- with 2 eggs, what's min # steps to find the floor in a 100-fl bldg at which
  dropping eggs breaks the eggs?
- what's smallest # yes/no questions to ask to determine a birthday if you
  have to prepare all the questions up-front (can't ask dynamically)? what
  are those questions?
- min # weighings to find fake (lighter/heavier) coin out of 12
- hat puzzle: $n$ prisoners given black/white hat. can't see own hat but can
  see others'. no communication. at least one must correctly say own hat
  color, else all executed. given prep planning time before test begins/hats
  given.
- num points on earth where going 1mi south, east, north goes back to origin
- (optimal stopping) given a sequence of $n$ ppl to date, where ppl are
  totally-ordered in how good a match they are for you, how many to reject/skip
  to maximize prob of accepting the best person?

Number theory
=============

- prove: for all ints $A,B$, there exist ints $C,D$ such that
  $2(A^2+B^2)=C^2+D^2$
  - eg, $2(4^2+7^2)=3^2+11^2$

Programming
===========

- how do you incrementally extend a hashtable?
- how to reverse the words in a string?

Probability
===========

- birthday problem: computable
- hat problem: actually a very hard problem
  - setup: 1000 ppl pile their hats, then each takes one.
  - originally asked in 6.431: what's E(X) where X is the number of ppl who
    get back their orig hat?
    - easy bc linearity of expectation doesn't require $X_i$ to be indep
    - just $n E[X_i] = n (1/n) = 1$
  - much harder: what's prob of ppl getting back their hat?
  - solvable via inclusion-exclusion principle:
    <http://www.mathnet.or.kr/mathnet/paper_file/Elizabethtown/Gabriela/Monmort.pdf>
  - but why isn't P(first person gets wrong hat) P(second person gets wrong
    hat | first person gets wrong hat) P(third person gets wrong hat | first
    two people get wrong hats) ... = 999/1000+998/999+997/998+...+2/3+1/2 =
    1/1000?
  - bc eg P(second person gets wrong hat | first person gets wrong hat) is
    not 998/999. first person may have taken second person's hat
  - harder versions: no two people get each other's hats either
- poisson approximation can solve the above and others (prob of drunken
  walker ending at start location):
