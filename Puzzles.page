Riddles
=======

- given two ropes that burn in 60m (non-uniformly), measure 15m
- with 2 eggs, what's min # steps to find the floor in a 100-fl bldg at which
  dropping eggs breaks the eggs?
- what's smallest # yes/no questions to ask to determine a birthday if you
  have to prepare all the questions up-front (can't ask dynamically)? what
  are those questions?
- min # weighings to find fake (lighter/heavier) coin out of 12
- hat puzzle: $n$ prisoners given black/white hat. can't see own hat but can
  see others'. no communication. at least one must correctly say own hat
  color, else all executed. given prep planning time before test begins/hats
  given.
- num points on earth where going 1mi south, east, north goes back to origin
- (optimal stopping) given a sequence of $n$ ppl to date, where ppl are
  totally-ordered in how good a match they are for you, how many to reject/skip
  to maximize prob of accepting the best person?
- 25 racehorses, 5 tracks, fewest # races to find top 3
- # ways to climb $n$ steps if you take 1-2 steps at a time?
- min # balance weighings to find heavier ball of 8? of 13? of $n$?
- 3 black hats, 2 white hats, 3 men in a line facing forward (can't see
  behind), each wearing a hat. they guess at their own hats. man in back says
  "i don't know," middle says "i don't know," front says "i know" - how does he
  know?
- digits AB+AA=1B2; A=?
- how many ways are there to walk up s steps if you can take 1 or 2 at a time?

Number theory
=============

- prove: for all ints $A,B$, there exist ints $C,D$ such that
  $2(A^2+B^2)=C^2+D^2$
  - eg, $2(4^2+7^2)=3^2+11^2$

Programming
===========

- how do you incrementally extend a hashtable?
- how to reverse the words in a string?
- binary search for circularly sorted array
- $n$ary search in 2D matrix where rows/cols are ordered
- given an array of $n$ positive numbers $A$, return array of $n$ numbers where
  element $i$ is the product of all numbers in $A$ except for element $A_i$.
  now do it when you have no division. now do it when you have no
  multiplication.
- given a set of strings xs and a string y, return subset of xs that are
  substrings of y

Probability
===========

- toss $m$ balls into $n$ bins; how many bins will be non-empty?
- $m$ bins; how many balls to toss so that $k$ of them are non-empty?
- birthday problem: computable
- hat problem: actually a very hard problem
  - setup: 1000 ppl pile their hats, then each takes one.
  - originally asked in 6.431: what's E(X) where X is the number of ppl who
    get back their orig hat?
    - easy bc linearity of expectation doesn't require $X_i$ to be indep
    - just $n E[X_i] = n (1/n) = 1$
  - much harder: what's prob of ppl getting back their hat?
  - solvable via inclusion-exclusion principle:
    <http://www.mathnet.or.kr/mathnet/paper_file/Elizabethtown/Gabriela/Monmort.pdf>
  - but why isn't P(first person gets wrong hat) P(second person gets wrong
    hat | first person gets wrong hat) P(third person gets wrong hat | first
    two people get wrong hats) ... = 999/1000+998/999+997/998+...+2/3+1/2 =
    1/1000?
  - bc eg P(second person gets wrong hat | first person gets wrong hat) is
    not 998/999. first person may have taken second person's hat
  - harder versions: no two people get each other's hats either
- poisson approximation can solve the above and others (prob of drunken
  walker ending at start location):
  <http://heroofourtime.blogspot.com/2010/11/birthday-problem.html>
- 5 men form a circle; prob that they're youngest-to-oldest (either dir)?
- prob of not rolling a 2 in 55 tosses of a 20-sided die is $.95^55$. prob of
  this for any of the 20 numbers?
- russian roulette: load 2 adjacent chambers. spin barrel. click. before
  pulling again, want to spin?

Geometry
========

- You are in a boat exactly at the center of a perfectly circular lake. On the shore, there is a thief who wants to take you hostage.

  You can run faster than the thief, if you make it to shore. But the thief can run 4 times as fast as you can row. The thief cannot swim and doesn’t have a boat.

  Can you escape the thief?

- can you draw a curve that crosses each border once?

Practical
=========

- 3 switches in room A, 3 bulbs in room B. how to tell which switches go to
  which bulbs if you're in room A, can move to room B, but can't go back to
  room A?

- which is the correct answer on this test question?

  1. 今天是个女日子，因为我在可逻辑学。
  2. 今天是个好日子，因为我在学逻辑学。
  3. 今天八个好日子，因为令在学逻辑学。
