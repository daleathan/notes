- Fitch Cheney's 5-card trick:

  The question concerns a "magic trick" involving playing cards, a standard 52-card deck.  There are two magicians, and they are working together.

  The first magician finds a member of the audience and asks them to pick out 5 cards from the deck and hand them back to him.  The magician takes a look at the 5 cards, chooses one of them, and hands it back to the audience member, asking him to look at it and hold on to it.  This is the secret card.

  The first magician then takes the remaining four cards, arranges them in some order and hands them to the second magician, who upon receiving the four cards is able to magically tell everyone what the secret card is!  ** Tada! **

Game theory
===========

- dividing pizza: I'll slice, and we'll take turns picking in a circle (only
  adj pieces), you pick first; better to have me odd or even num slices?

- cannibals:

  A traveler gets lost on a deserted island and finds himself surrounded by a
  group of n cannibals.

  Each cannibal wants to eat the traveler but, as each knows, there is a risk.
  A cannibal that attacks and eats the traveler would become tired and
  defenseless. After he eats, he would become an easy target for another
  cannibal (who would also become tired and defenseless after eating).

  The cannibals are all hungry, but they cannot trust each other to cooperate.
  The cannibals happen to be well versed in game theory, so they will think
  before making a move.

  Does the nearest cannibal, or any cannibal in the group, devour the lost
  traveler?

Number theory
=============

- prove: for all ints $A,B$, there exist ints $C,D$ such that
  $2(A^2+B^2)=C^2+D^2$
  - eg, $2(4^2+7^2)=3^2+11^2$

  multiplication.
- given a set of strings xs and a string y, return subset of xs that are
  substrings of y
- come up with a $O(n \log n)$ algo for computing kendall-tau

  $j-i$ where $A_i<A_j$ (harder: in $O(n)$!)
- find the *majority* element in a stream
- longest palindromic substring: brute force, then in $O(n^2)$ time/space, then
  in $O(1)$ space, then in $O(n)$ time/space (hard)

  that will kill a pig in exactly 30 minutes. What's the minimum number of pigs
  you need to determine which bucket is poisoned in 30m? an hour?

- One hundred people board a 100-seat airplane. The first one has lost his
  boarding pass, so he sits in a random seat. Each subsequent passenger sits in
  his own seat if it’s available or takes a random unoccupied seat if it’s not.

  What’s the probability that the 100th passenger finds his seat occupied?

- You are in a boat exactly at the center of a perfectly circular lake. On the shore, there is a thief who wants to take you hostage.

  You can run faster than the thief, if you make it to shore. But the thief can run 4 times as fast as you can row. The thief cannot swim and doesn’t have a boat.

  Can you escape the thief?

General math
============

- find $x$ if $x^{x^{x^\dots}} = 2$
- find all real/complex roots of $x^6 = 64$
- hour/minute hands of clock meet at 12:00; when will they first meet again?
- 3 points randomly drawn on circle; prob of them being on same semi-circle?
- unit length broken off into 3 pieces; prob of forming triangle?
- $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}}$
- You have 5 unknown numbers. There are 10 options in selecting two out of
  these five. Sum each of those two together, thus you have 10 numbers. You're
  given these, find the original 5 numbers.
- Given two vectors $x,y$ of $N$ elements where first $M$ are numbers and
  remaining are letters from an alphabet, want to find:

  `distance(x,y) = l1_distance(x[1..M], y[1..M]) + hamming_distance(x[M+1..N], y[M+1..N])`

  E.g., `hamming_distance([a,b,c], [a,a,c]) = 1`

  What $f$ will let us compute this using just L1 distance?

  `distance(x,y) = l1_distance(f(x), f(y))`
