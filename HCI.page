people

- marissa mayer: all google changes go through her; she's backlogged majorly

laws

- fitts' law: time to point to target area is fn of target size/distance
- steering law: time to steer through 2D tunnel; applied to cascading menus

Processing (Ben Fry's talk at CSAIL 5/16/08)

- looks like a system for making slick "interactive animated visualization"
- language gets rid of a lot of verbosity associated with straight java
- make things accessible that aren't possible without programming
- asdf

touch, tabletop, and tangible blocks (patrick baudisch, msr, prof at hasso-plattner-institut)

- a lot of prior work in trying to improve touch interfaces, incl. patrick's
  work in beneath-the-table touch
- aside: iphone corrects touches by a fixed vector
- knowing the yaw and rotation each improve accuracy
- from 15mm to 5mm buttons at 90% accuracy
- use fingerprint

reflow: recalculating positions when eg resizing a window

data visualizations

- boxplots
- candlestick plots: thick is open/close, thin is intraday high/low, green is
  "closed higher"
- stemplots: use text to convey distribution
  - <http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/stem-and-leaf.html>
- rose/coxcomb diagram: evenly sized polar segments (eg months), different
  wedge sizes (may have layers)
  - <http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/crimea-rose.html>
- box-and-whisker
- hierarchical
  - treemaps
  - ringmaps/multi-level pies/sunburst/wedge stack graph
  - icicle tree
  - spacetrees: scope context to selected node in tree
  - bubble plots
  - nested column plots
- high-dimensional
  - parallel coordinates
- time series
  - index charts: all about relative change with respect to reference month
    (all stocks pass through one point)

interaction techniques

- brushing: selecting data in one view and updating others
