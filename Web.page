safe fonts

- sans-serif
  - arial
  - verdana
  - helvetica?
- monospace
  - courier new
- serif
  - georgia
  - times new roman

rss

- some web-based feed readers include subscriber counts in their user agent
  strings
  - eg "Bloglines/3.1 (http://www.bloglines.com; 602 subscribers)"
- <http://www.rss4lib.com/2007/05/counting_rss_subscribers.html>

3D

- webgl: low-level JS API based on opengl es 2.0
- O3D: scene graph; built on webgl & js as of 5-2010; was originally a plugin

encodings

- url encoding: `user%40domain.com`, `hello%20world`, `%6A` for `j`
- html encoding: `1 &lt; 2`, `&#x6A` for `j`
- javascript escaping: eg for json
- css escaping

HTTP

- cookies
  - subdomains can set for parent domains, *except* for TLDs (edu) due to dot restriction
  - domains must contain at least 2-3 dots, depending on what kind of TLD (.com, .va.us)
  - <http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html>

flash RTFMP

- udp only (RTMP is the tcp-based one)
- can make p2p connections using RTFMP server (eg adobe stratus) as rendezvous
- server maintains list of potential peers that can be connected to
  - server assigns temp uniq IDs to connections from SWFs
  - other SWFs connected to server can subscribe to streams and events from
    that ID once the bcasting SWF agrees to the connection
  - if NetConnection to server is lost/closed, any peer connection is also
    closed
- server also assists in nat-t; supports TURN
- in flash 10; see NetConection, NetStream objects
- security
  - privacy: 128-bit AES encryption; key negotiated with D-H
  - auth: none, but provides secure nonces to aid with app-level auth
  - only enables sending media from mic/cam to other flash player endpoints
    that subscribe to media streams

session continuity

- persistence
  - cookies
  - window.name: only for this tab session
  - HTTP authentication
  - flash local shared objects (LSOs)
  - HTML5
- message passing
  - hidden form fields
  - URL query string

misc

- `rel=nofollow`: indicates to search engine that a link should not influence
  the target's ranking

techniques

- css spriting: combining multiple images into one (reducing requests) and
  cutting pieces out using css

browser plugins

- plugins like flash can be windowed for perf, or windowless (opaque or transparent)
- z-ordering
  - certain browser elements like native widgets or iframes are traditionally also windowed
  - windowed elements are all drawn on top of other elements
  - de-facto standard practice: use iframes to pos things atop other windows
- harder to smoothly (synchronously) scroll windowed plugins
- must desynchronize for responsiveness, but windowless
gtk, moz moving to eliminate widgets in own native windows

session management

- 3 techniques to pass around session IDs: URLs, cookies, and hidden fields
  (for POSTs only)

x drawables TODO

xt: ancient toolkit for windowed plugins

3 old techniques for dynamically typed languages on language vm's
- all objects in lang subclass a common root object; lots of cons
- reflection: may be mismatch for lang type concepts
- interpreter: slow
invokedynamic
- opcode identifies method name & type (which can be very generic, e.g. (Object;Object)Object)
- a bootstrap method is registered with a class
- first time you encounter a particular invokedynamic in some class C's method, call C's bootstrap method
- bootstrap method is passed the calling class C, method name, method type
- return a CallSite whose target has been set to some MethodHandle (a pointer to a method)
- for some reason, the CallSite ctor takes the same args as the bootstrap method; not sure how this is used
- as side effect, the CallSite may be stored away in a data structure managed by the lang runtime, so that it can be retargeted in the future

Google SPDY (Alyssa (Rzeszutek) Wilk, talk at MIT 12/8/2009)

- HTTP protocol built on TCP; former internal name "FLIP"
- features
  - basic
    - multiplexed streams: done by packetizing/framing (has SYN, DATA, FIN
      pkts)
    - prioritization: advisory, per-req; can reduce load times by eg loading js
      first that processes while other resources are loading
      - determined entirely by browser
    - header compression: gzip dicts are kept across reqs
  - advanced (optional
    - server push: avoid half the round trip of having client send a req
    - hints: client *may* request this soon, but don't xmit yet
- status
  - protocol still being developed
  - will be opt-in in chrome; built in-memory server
  - will do out-of-lab experiments, deploying across google services
- performance
  - 40% fewer packets than compressed HTTP, 15% fewer bytes
  - 88% header compression, 85% resp hdr compression
  - saved 45-1142ms per page load
- real world pkt loss is ~1%; SPDY is 41-47% faster for PL btwn 1-2% because
  (1) fewer packets and (2) prioritization
- SSL: a bunch of remaining work/issues; want to negotiate SPDY as part of SSL
  handshake
- future work
  - caching implications: what are latency implications of not using proxy
    caches, etc? (can't proxy bc not enough support for SPDY)
  - unidirectional streams: replace bidir streams + half-close
  - flow control: backoff + GOAWAY; if server overloaded, tell client "slow
    down" or lose benefits
  - insecure content: classify data as public + cacheable?
- related work
  - HTTP over SCTP
  - SST

decentralized identity/auth/social standards

- types
  - identity/SSO: manage a single centralized identity; need only sign on once
- windows live ID aka ms passport aka ms wallet: identity/SSO; an openid
  provider
- openauth: identity/SSO; access authorization
  - by AOL; auth AOL/AIM users
- openid: authentication
- oauth: authentication and authorization
  - 3-legged: normal auth flow; requires access token
  - 2-legged: domain admin authorizes req for all users; no access token
    - server-to-server, no user
  - flow:
    - all app.com to platform.com requests are https and signed for app.com
      authenticity; valid methods are hmac-sha1 w key = shared-secret,
      rsa-sha1, plaintext
    - user goes to app.com/welcome w button to app.com/connect
    - /connect requests reqtoken, reqsecret from https://platform.com/initiate;
      this also sets callback for the reqtoken to be http://app.com/ready
    - /connect redirects to https://platform.com/authorize?reqtoken=blah
    - user redirected to app.com/ready?reqtoken=blah&verifier=blah
    - /ready requests platform.com to verify (reqtoken, verifier) and return
      accesstoken
- opensocial: social network API (JS for gadgets, REST for else)
- friend connect: opensocial router and gadgets
- facebook connect: links acounts elsewhere with facebook accts
- facebook platform: everything

- google: adding .5s lost 20% traffic <http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html>
- brokers could lose $4M revenue/ms if etrading platform 5ms behind competition <http://www.tabbgroup.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=346>
- <http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/7/25/latency-is-everywhere-and-it-costs-you-sales-how-to-crush-it.html>

online advertisement

- cost per mille/impression (CPM): per 1,000 views
- cost per click (CPC)
- cost per action (CPA): per purchase
- cost per engagement (CPE): interact with ad

caching

- edge side includes (ESIs): small markup lang for dynamic web content in
  caches
  - developed by a group of companies incl. akamai, bea, oracle)
  - eg `<esi:include src="http://example.com/1.html" alt="http://bak.example.com/2.html" onerror="continue"/>`

html5

- simpler doctype, charset
- tags
  - section: group related content
  - article: section that can stand alone
  - header: heading, intro, nav, etc; non-recursive
  - hgroup: special header that contains only 2+ h1-h6 elts
  - nav: section of nav links
  - aside: section of tangentially related content
  - figure: essential content but not nec inline
  - footer: add'l info: signature, related links, copyright; non-rec
  - address: email contact info

sync kit (marcua, edbenson, www10)

- idea: easier way to utilize client-side db caching
- sync primitives: sets, queues
- instead of:

    template = Template('index.template')
    results = db.query('select * from users where ...')
    return template.render(results)

  or "flying templates" (shipping just the data, relying on client cache of
  template):

    template = Template('index.template')
    results = db.query('select * from users where ...')
    return flying([template, results])

  return:

    template = Template('index.template')
    return synckit([template,
        Queue(table='users', order='DESC', filter='predicate', ...)])

- perf eval: higher tput, competitive (slightly better) latency
  - higher tput from network-bound workloads
  - latency comes from client-side processing + local db queries
