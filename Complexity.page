TODO merge in notes from CS172

- classes
  - \#P ???
    - \#P-complete
      - counting reductions
      - contains some easy P problems
    - eg: dnf-sat, 2sat, permanent of a matrix, number of perfect matchings for a bipartite graph

- _kolmogorov complexity_ of a string is min len of computer programming (in
  some universal lang) to output that string

On Non-Computable Functions (Tibor Rado 1962)

- used TMs
- $\Sigma(n)$: max length of computation by a TM of size $n$
  - aka the _Busy Beaver function_
- $S(n)$: max length of computation by a TM of size $n$ that eventually stops
- _Busy Beaver game_: try to make TMs of a given size that ran for as long as
  possible (but stopped)
- led to a slew of papers about busy beavers
  - favorite pastime: compute $\Sigma(n), S(n)$ by hand
    - requires analyzing all TMs of given size to figure out whether it stops
    - if so, how long it runs, and what number it prints

Computer Studies of Turing Machine Problems (Rado, Shen Lin, 1965)

- computer analyzez easy machines; hard ones by hand
- proved $\Sigma(1) = 1, S(1) = 1, \Sigma(2) = 4, S(2) = 6$
- Lin's PhD thesis: $\Sigma(3) = 6, S(3) = 21$
- Allen Brady, 1983: $\Sigma(4) = 13, S(4) = 107$
