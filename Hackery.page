- process monitoring/management

  - supervisord
    - directly monitors children; no sub-children, no forking/start cmds
    - ugly configparser files
    - less control than god
    - only very basic monitoring controls + event-listening extension system
    - online reloading (`reread` then `update`) isn't that great
      - misses certain changes, e.g. to events for event listener
      - changed processes are restarted on `update`
    - only one group per program
  - god
    - reports of problems running and memory leaks
      - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/768184/god-vs-monit>
      - <http://blog.bradgessler.com/use-monit-with-rails-not-god>
    - I also had problems with god hanging when playing with it
    - unmaintained since Feb 2009
  - monit
    - nice but new language
    - most actively maintained
    - unlike god/supervisord:
      - only supports running in fresh environment
      - no stdout/stderr redirection
    - only uses forking/start cmds; no child supervision
    - advanced monitoring checks
    - dependencies, but only process-based, not listening port-based
    - janky; single-threaded architecture gets stuck waiting for pidfile to
      appear and can't respond to control
      - very slow/sluggish feeling
    - can monitor process trees, unlike the others
  - upstart
    - designed for child supervision
    - root user only; only supports running as root
    - simple, restricted language
    - no stdout/stderr redirection
    - also actively maintained; ubuntu's "success story"
    - dependencies
    - details
      - "stop on stopped foo" will stop this job even if foo just dies (doesn't
        have to be explicitly stopped)
      - stopping: first sends TERM, then KILL after 5s (`kill timeout 5`)
        - log if exited with non-0, logged
      - upstart takes care of `start on runlevel [2345]`
        - don't create /etc/rc?.d/ symlinks
        - ubuntu has symlinks in /etc/init.d/ to upstart-job only for compat
          - perhaps users or other programs expect these there
          - none of them have symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/

- nagios

  - pros/features/highlights
    - event processing system; events can be restarts, alerts, logging, etc.
    - large ecosystem; biggest of all monitoring systems; many existing plugins
    - web interface to see current status
    - passive as well as active plugins; not just cron
    - simple plugin API: any command line tool
    - results caching, service dependencies, adaptive monitoring
    - on-call notification rotations, escalations
  - cons
    - very easy to re-implement these checks
    - yet another system to learn, with its own config labyrinth
      (self-advertised as complex)
    - everything is periodic, has delay
    - no integration with trend monitoring systems; no data accumulation
    - how is it for EC2-like places where instances are expected to fail?
    - polling duration can exceed period, causing problems
  - details
    - define hosts, cmds, services (what cmds to run on what hosts)
    - external command file: where other programs send nagios internal cmds
      (not cmd-line cmds) to run
    - active plugins: exit status 0-3 determine state
    - distributed montoring: ssh/NRPE for active, NSCA for passive, SNMP
    - passive plugins: checks _external command file_ every minute by default
      - can check for sufficient freshness
    - both queue results; checked every 5s by default by _reaper_
    - volatile: state-triggered (v edge-triggered)
    - ndoutils: store in mysql; will probably be nagios default in future
    - stalking: logging all
    - often integrated with cacti/rrdtool for trend monitoring?

- monitoring systems (2008)
  - nagios: see section
  - zenoss (core): zope
    - web/daemon/data-tier arch; data in cmdb (cfg), rrd (hist), mysql (events)
    - uses snmp (req'd), nagios plugins, zenpacks (cmds, tmpls, graphs)
    - all cfg via web ui or api
      - tmpls; production states for servers; alert severities; locations
    - integrates events and trends; nice/confusing gui
    - scalable server
    - missing commercial features in zenoss enterprise
  - zabbix
    - lightweight agent/php/db-tier arch
    - simple checks; agents; snmp; external/internal/aggregated checks
    - auto discovery (agent based)
    - fully integrated alerting, reporting, trending
    - create own screens w tmpls; correlation of graphs
    - cons: cumbersome config; reporting not great; no escalation
  - hyperichq
    - java; pg
    - focus on app internals (mysql, pg, jboss); great for debugging
    - integrated with opennms; similar frameworks; complementary
    - auto-detection; best graphing; easy config; nice GUI
    - not for typical lamp shop; lots of features in commercial version
  - opsview enterprise
    - set of nagios exts for scaling, web (catalyst), mysql
    - HA/LB monitoring; multi slaves, single master
    - nagvis, rrdtool for trending

- ubuntu
  - `-dbgsym` packages have debug symbols for all binaries
  - user adm is for viewing system logs; user admin is for sudo

- LDAP
  - hierarchical directory of entries of KV attr pairs (defined by schema)
    - schemas define _object classes_; published at a base DN in
      subschemaSubentry _operational attr_ (system attr)
    - obj ID is _distinguished name (DN)_
  - topmost levels usu. reflect DNS (eg `dc=example,dc=org`)
  - directory system agent (DSA): an LDAP server; default port 389
  - can refer to other servers
  - request types
    - start TLS
    - bind: authenticate w user DN and passwd, specify version (normally LDAPv3)
    - search: base obj, scope, filter, deref aliases?, attrs (projection),
      size/time limits, types only?
    - compare: check DN has attr pair
    - add/delete/modify: takes DN and list of attrs
    - extended ops: eg cancel, passwd modify
    - abandon: abort an operation named by a msg ID; unfortunately no response,
      so cancel extension was introduced
    - unbind: abandon ops, close conn

- active directory
  - LDAP, modified KRB, DNS, SSO, app roaming storage, admin/policy/deploy

    - primary DC, backup DC, or domain member: older NT model
    - now 1+ equal peer DCs; multi-master repl (configurable sync/async/etc)
  - introduced in win2k

- samba: impls SMB/CIFS and domain membership; v4 can serve as AD DC (future)
  - NBT, SMB/CIFS, DCE/RPC, MSRPC, network neighborhood, WINS server called
    NBNS, SAM, LSA, SPOOLSS, NTLM, AD logon

- pylons/paster
  - paster
    - `sys.exit(load_entry_point('PasteScript','console_scripts','paster'))`

      entrypoints?)
    - `--plugin` for extensibility
  - pylons
    - `appconfig` loads config
    - `loadapp` loads config and creates app
    - `loadserver` loads config and creates server
    - all above take URLs like `config:development.ini`
  - `paster setup-app development.ini`
    - `[app:main]` in .ini points to egg for your app ("myapp")
    - myapp's `paste.app_install` entrypoint is `pylons.util.PylonsInstaller`
    - `Installer` objects run `setup_app` (or `setup_config`) in `websetup`
      - passes paste's `appconfig()` into `setup_app`
  - `paster serve development.ini`
    - serve command calls `loadapp` and `loadserver`
    - `loadapp` uses entrypoint `paste.app_factory`, points to
      `myapp.config.middleware`
    - `middleware` is passed `global_conf` (`[DEFAULT]` in .ini) and `app_conf`
      (`[app:main]` in .ini)
      - calls `load_environment`: creates/returns `pylons.config =
        pylons.configuration.PylonsConfig`
      - creates `PylonsApp` as stack of middleware initialized by `config`
    - the config is then registered into `pylons.config` by `PylonsApp` via
      `paste.registry.register` (pushed onto a stacked proxy object)
    - config has local_conf and global_conf sub-dicts

    site-packages/package.egg/EGG-INFO

- net booting, old to new: etherboot (95), intel PXE (99, TFTP), gPXE (SAN)

- android
  - processes can be shared by multiple apps
  - on backgrounding, apps are signaled to save their state
  - OS will kill bg procs under pressure
  - philosophy: don't distinguish btwn background/stopped apps
  - broadcast receivers: given 10 seconds to handle broadcast events like alarms and arrived-at-location
  - services: longer-running bg ops

- email agents
  - MUA: client for reading/composing messages, eg mutt
  - MSA: recv from MUA, send to MTA; most MTAs also MSAs
    - uses: correct errors (eg missing date/msg-id/domain), simplify MTA
      policies (refuse mail to non-locals, stricter spam setting)
  - MTA aka relay: xfer msgs to/from this host; uses SMTP
    - exim is officially supported on ubuntu; also sendmail (older, famously
      insecure)
    - each MTA adds `Received` hdr
    - major MTAs (monolithic = less secure)
      - sendmail: popular, once-insecure, monolithic
      - exim: monolithic, ok security record, sendmail drop-in
      - postfix: modular, secure (by sec guy), performant, sendmail drop-in,
        easy
      - qmail: secure (by djb), updated in 99, modular, weird to use
      - <http://shearer.org/MTA_Comparison>
    - MTAs have configurable policies/processing; eg postfix can spawn a cmd,
      pipe to a persistent cmd, etc
    - port 587 used for MUA-MSA; port 25 used for MTA-MTA; most servers just
      use 25
  - MDA: recv msgs to local user, store in inbox; eg procmail (old; most MTAs
    are also MDAs)
  - MRA: retrieve via POP, IMAP, etc; eg fetchmail, getmail (python successor)
  - outlook, thunderbird, etc: MUAs that also have some MSA, MDA, MRA

- email configuration
  - /etc/mailname: the domain of this machine
    - eg cron jobs are from/to this domain
    - this is what postfix should set as mydestination

- fail2ban: scans logs and bans IPs w too many failed attempts
  - update iptables FW or tcp wrapper's hosts.deny

- php
  - `php -a`: if built w readline support, then behave as console

      - InputFormat: FileInputFormat:
        - SequenceFileInputFormat: uses SequenceFileRecordReader
        - TextInputFormat: uses LineRecordReader
        - KeyValueInputFormat: tab-separated lines
  - serialization
    - Writable: WritableComparable:
      - hadoop records aka Jute
        - used in RPC
        - primitives: byte, bool, int, long, float, double, ustring, buffer
          - buffer (BytesWritable): use this for eg protobufs
        - composites: record, vector, map
          - Record: abstract; for generated classes
          - DDL (link.jr) to `rcc -l C++` or `Java`

              module links {

              }

        - encodings: binary, CSV, XML
    - avro
    - hadoop
      - used to require keys/values to be Writables, but now uses Serializers
        and class factories
        - there's WritableSerialization
    - old
      - RecordReader: also had DBRecordReader

- disks
  - sector: 512 B
  - partition: physical region on disk; serves as a storage container
    - windows PC: first partition starts at sector 63
  - volume: OS abstraction for storage container
    - usu just a single partition
    - logical volume managers (LVMs) can create virtual volumes; eg concat or
      stripe partitions

- lvm
  - features: live PV adds/removes; resize partitions; snapshots; span many
    disks; RAID0/1
  - _physical volumes (PVs)_ are real partitions or whole disks
  - _volume groups (VGs)_ of PVs are logical disks
  - _logical volumes (LVs)_ are partitions of VGs
  - can resize LVs; just first resize FS to be same/smaller
  - reiserfs has fast resizing, unlike ext3
  - lvm2: read-write snapshots; fragile, don't be too fancy
  - default extent ('chunk') size 4MB
  - keeps metadata header at start of each PV; each PV has UUID

    - implements MVCC; has true serializability bc of shared index locks,
      unlike PG (and future locks or gap locks can be taken on these)
      - each row has 3 new fields
        - 7-byte ID of last updating (or deleting) txn
        - 7-byte ptr to undo log record (undo log is called the _rollback
          segment_)
        - 6-byte monotonically increasing row ID
      - <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-multi-versioning.html>
    - storage format
      - if table has int primary key, use that as tuple id; otherwise add tuple
        id for each tuple
      - var-len cols
        - compact/redundant ("antelope"): up to 768B in record (for prefix
          indexes), rest in overflow page
          - at least 2 rows + some metadata must fit in each 16KB page, so
            limit for whole row is ~8KB
        - dynamic/compressed ("barracuda"): 20B ptr whenever not fit; prefix
          index can be built separately
        - each value has exclusive overflow pages; no sharing
  - monitoring/mgmt
    - `show engine innodb status`
    - `show processlist`
    - `kill 3` kills process 3 in processlist
  - clustering
    - built-in async stmt-/row-based replication
      - ship stmts/rows/mixed via binary log
        - log after update completion but before lock release/commit to ensure
          log is in execution order
      - mixed: rows automatically used when non-deterministic queries executed
      - single thread on slave replays log updates
      - only innodb synchronizes w the binary log
      - row-based supported by innodb in some cases
      - auto-inc fields lock table for non-simple inserts
      - setup/resync of slave is a bit complicated
        - manual monitoring/failover with `stop slave; reset master` on
          promotee and `change master to` on new slaves
        - first, wait for `stop slave io_thread; show processlist` to say "Has
          read all relay log"
        - more details: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-solutions-switch.html>
    - google's 5.5 patches add semisync replication
      - master confirms receipt & logging of update by at least one slave
      - only adds wait after commit completes; since commit actually happened,
        master & slave are actually out of sync (eg if crash during wait,
        committed txn may not have made it to slave)
    - mysql cluster: ndb with mysql
      - ndb is also some sort of standalone clustering solution
      - ndb supports scalable sync replication & partitioning using 2PC
      - in-mem; async disk log of redo records and chkpts (2s log write period)
      - much slower than standard replication
      - can replicate btwn ndb clusters or btwn ndb & other engines via
        standard replication
    - tungsten replicator
      - simple setup, stmt-based, sync, global txids, cross-dbms
      - supports mysql, oracle, jdbc; future: postgresql, others

    - pg now has async replication; that was mysql's only strong pt against pg
      - neither has synchronous replication, but pg's is coming
      - semisync still unsafe; master waits *after* actually committing
        locally, instead of blocking the commit (as it should)
      - recovery is complex
    - no group commit <http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/07/13/testing-the-group-commit-fix/>
    - crappy concurrency, >3 sucks vs pg <http://spyced.blogspot.com/2006/12/benchmark-postgresql-beats-stuffing.html>
    - multiple storage engines has always restricted progress:

    - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324935/mysql-with-clause>
    - <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=10327>
    - postgresql also supported multiple storage engines in 80s; concentrated
      on one
      - mysql's engine arch is poor; bad to opt/plan/tune
    - only recently
      - per-stmt triggers
      - procedural lang support
    - only own internal auth system; pg supports a wide array
    - no referential integrity
    - no constraints (`check`)
    - no sort merge join (certainly no map-reduce contender), let alone
      hash-join
    - postgresql has more supple `alter table` impl
    - mysql doesn't support ASC/DESC clauses for indexes

    - optimizer only recently started working properly with certain subqueries
    - auto_increment jumps up to next power of 2 but inconsistently across
      versions (platforms?); this is undocumented
    - crappy errors: "Incorrect key file for table 'stock'; try to repair it"
      on "alter table stock add constraint pk_stock primary key (s_w_id,
      s_i_id);" where `stock` is in InnoDB (which has no "repair table") means
      I have no `/tmp` space (no Google answers)
    - crappy EXPLAIN output
    - innodb auto-extends ibdata1 file; only way to trim (garbage collect) is
      dumping and loading
    - scoping is broken

       mysql> create table t(a int, b int);
       Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.30 sec)
       mysql> select a, (select count(*) from (select b from t where a = u.a group by b) v) from t u;
       ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'u.a' in 'where clause'

    - optimizer sucks

  - tips
    - `set global general_log = 'ON'` or `'OFF'`
    - `set session sql_log_off = 1`
    - `load data infile` 20x faster `insert`; else, use txns, `insert delayed`,
      multi-valued `insert`
    - `--safe-updates`/`--i-am-a-dummy`: guard against mass deletes/updates
      that are missing `where` clauses
  - grant tables: user, db, host, tables_priv, columns_priv
    - created by mysql_upgrade and mysql_install_db
  - "engine" is newer term for "type"
    - `create table t (i int) engine=innodb`
    - `--default-storage-engine=innodb`
    - built-ins
      - myisam: non-txn'l; default; fast
      - memory: non-txn'l; non-persistent
      - merge: non-txn'l; read-only
        - merges identical myisam's into 1 logical table
        - insert into physical table; query from merged
      - innodb: txn'l; foreign key integrity
      - bdb: txn'l; removed in 5.1

        - pgpool-II
    - has had async WAL-shipping replication, but this ships WAL segments
      instead of records
      - only ships archived WAL segments; controlled with eg `archive_timeout`
      - lag is on order of minutes; uses commands like `scp` or `cp`
    - to check for stale reads, can compare `pg_current_xlog_location()` and
      `pg_last_xlog_replay_location()`
    - slony: built by jan weick, postgresql core team member; main option
      - much slower/uses more resources than mysql built-in replication
      - $O(n^2)$ communication costs
      - sql-/trigger-based replication
      - auto failover
    - 2PC: `prepare transaction`, `commit prepared`, `rollback prepared`
    - pgpool-II
      - synchronous replication, auto failover, connection pooling/load
        balancing, online recovery
      - sync replication: 30% write overhead, avoid non-pure queries
      - 9.0 async replication: provides auto failover, conn pooling, load bal,
        etc.
    - pgbouncer: simple, lightweight connection and transaction pooling
    - skytools
      - pgq: efficient transactional queue
      - londiste: async replication via pgq; cross-version support
      - plproxy: partitioning/rpc
  - WAL
    - segments are separate 16MB files
    - checkpoints taken by default every 3 WAL segments or 5m
  - has async api
  - monitoring/introspection
    - `select * from pg_stat_activity`: see current queries/activity
    - `select * from pg_locks where not granted`: see locks
  - rules: query rewriting, eg let you insert/update a view and redirect to
    underlying table(s)
  - triggers: executed in-transaction
  - notify/listen: messaging to clients
    - sent only after commit
    - received only when not in txn
    - like unix signals, many redundant signals can be reduced to one, and
      can't carry extra data
    - can use rules to generate

- DWARF2
  - unwind tables
    - `-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`: table is exact at each instr boundary, so
      can be used to unwind from async events (debugger, GC)
      - even when `-fomit-frame-pointer`
      - put in ELF section `.eh_frame_hdr`; used by gdb, `backtrace()` (even
        though docs say `-fomit-frame-pointer` breaks it)
      - not stripped; not a normal debug section, but an allocated data section
    - must have accurate tables through 100% of binaries, eg libc

- i18n
  - Unicode
    - 1.0: 1991; 16 bits; UCS-1, UCS-2, UCS-4
    - 2.0: 1996; 21 bits; UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
  - Unicode is basically identical to Universal Multi-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS or ISO/IEC 10646)
    - but UCS goes up to 31 bits instead of 20.1
    - the two standards weren’t always the same — in the 90s, there was a lot
      of disagreement between the computer companies who backed Unicode and
      proposed a simple 16-bit character set, and the standards mavens behind
      UCS, who wanted to accommodate more languages than 65,536 characters
      would allow. The two sides eventually compromised on the current 20.1-bit
      character set, but some historical differences still linger between the
      two “official” specifications
    - <http://blog.ksplice.com/2010/03/longest-tweet/>
  - ASCII: 7 bits
  - ISO/IEC 8859-1 aka Latin-1: superset of ASCII; 191 chars
  - ISO-8859-1: superset of ISO/IECS 8859-1
    - combines with ISO 6429 control chars ("C0 and C1 control chars")
    - assigns control chars to 00-1F, 7F, 80-9F
  - Windows-1252: superset of ISO/IEC 8859-1
    - uses 8 bits; assigns 80-9F displayable chars (not control chars)
  - UTF-7: for encoding unicode in ascii, eg in email; security issues
  - UTF-8: superset of ASCII; everything else -> multibyte
    - 00-7F (7 bits): 0_______
    - 0080-07FF (11 bits): 110_____ 10______
    - 0800-FFFF (16 bits): 1110____ 10______ 10______
    - 010000-10FFFF (21 bits): 11110___ 10______ 10______ 10______

- Hotspot

  - objects 64-bit aligned, have 2-word header (word = native ptr size)

  - From <http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/whitepaper.html>

    > In the Java HotSpot VM, no handles are used by Java code. Object
    > references are implemented as direct pointers. This provides C-speed
    > access to instance variables. When an object is relocated during memory
    > reclamation, the garbage collector is responsible for finding and
    > updating all references to the object in place.

  - raw pointers not too bad to update since you must traverse all objects
    anyway

    - they probably use the mark word to redirect to the new location

  - GC: generational; parallel young

  - objects copied in DFS; this clusters related objects together

  - vocab
    - _ordinary object pointer (OOP)_

  - compressed OOPs: in Java 7; 32-bit ptrs
    - `wide_oop = narrow_oop == 0 ? 0 : (narrow_oop << 3) + base`
    - allows up to 4B objs/32GB

  - Each object has special first word for synchronization, marking, hashing

    > First word of each object is the _mark word_
    >
    > Used for synchronization and GC
    >
    > Also caches hashcode, if previously computed

  - from <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-benchmark1.html>
    - blocks need to execute 1500 (client) or 10000 (server) times before
      they're JITed
      - compile whole method
      - on-stack replacement: can replace with compiled method in middle of a
        call to it (eg if loops in main)
        - however, code quality suboptimal: can't do loop-hoisting,
          array-bounds check elimination, or loop unrolling
        - only way to defeat this: move tight loops into their own methods
    - code can be deoptimized if assumptions made during JIT no longer hold
      - eg class loading that invalidates monomorphic call transformations
      - eg uncommon traps: only the most common code path is compiled (like in
        tracing JIT?), but turns out to be uncommon
    - dead code elimination
    - memory optimizations
      - hoisting heap values into registers
      - stack allocation
      - object eplosion

  - parallel GC: actually a stop-the-world on “young generation”
    - “parallel” means implemented w threads for better speed
  - ConcurrentMarkSweep GC = “Full GC”
    - apart from initial mark and final cleanup phase, it is really concurrent,
      meaning that it runs in parallel to the normal process

- alignment

  - `posix_memalign`: useful for aligning to cache line sizes

- sockets

  - on linux, default: SO_RCVBUF = 87380, SO_SNDBUF = 16384

- non-blocking IO quirks

  - sockets that are accepted from a non-blocking listener are blocking

  - EAGAIN == EWOULDBLOCK == 11

  - From select(2):

    > Under Linux, select() may report a socket file descriptor as "ready for
    > reading", while nevertheless a subsequent read blocks.  This could for
    > example happen when data has arrived but upon exam‐ ination has wrong
    > checksum and is discarded.  There may be other circumstances in which a
    > file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready.  Thus it may be safer to
    > use O_NONBLOCK on sockets that should not block.

  - From [section 13.2 of the
    manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Primitives.html#I_002fO-Primitives):

    > EAGAIN
    >
    > Normally, when no input is immediately available, read waits for some
    > input. But if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file (see File Status
    > Flags), read returns immediately without reading any data, and reports
    > this error.

- listen actually accepts connections (based on the backlog argument)
  - accept just takes one of the already-accepted connections

- inotify: Linux's filesystem change notification facility
  - obsoletes dnotify
  - difficult for efficient (real-time) detection due to coarse granularity
    (directory level)

- tcp wrapper (TCP_WRAPPERS)
  - libwrap: just the library
  - openssh's sshd uses libwrap

- /dev/shm/: tmpfs (in-memory)

- strace more comprehensive than ltrace

- Collada DAE files: standard 3D model interchange format established by the
  Khronos group (established at SIGGRAPH 06 to maintain OpenGL)

- status of AIO

  - From <http://davmac.org/davpage/linux/async-io.html>:

    > A more subtle problem with non-blocking I/O is that it generally doesn't
    > work with regular files (this is true on linux, even when files are
    > opened with O_DIRECT; possibly not on other operating systems). That is,
    > opening a regular file in non-blocking mode has no effect for regular
    > files: a read will always actually read some of the file, even if the
    > program blocks in order to do so. In some cases this may not be
    > important, seeing as file I/O is generally fast enough so as to not cause
    > long blocking periods (so long as the file is local and not on a network,
    > or a slow medium). However, it is a general weakness of the technique.
    >
    > ...
    >
    > The select() function is documented in the libc manual. As noted, a file
    > descriptor for a regular file is considered ready for reading if it's not

    > As with non-blocking I/O, select is no solution for regular files (which

  - From <http://www.mail-archive.com/libevent-users@monkey.org/msg01226.html>:

    > I wouldn't expect AIO to knock your socks off on Linux (and certainly not
    > *BSDs). Kernel support doesn't exist for AIO operating through the disk

  - atomic field updaters

- reentrancy
  - aka "purity"; output depends only on inputs (and static constants); no
    static state is changed (no side effects)
  - an interrupt handler is reentrant if it reenables interrupts early on
  - implies thread safety

- thread safety
  - ways to realize:
    - reentrancy: state is private per caller (eg on stack)
    - mutual exclusion: can update static state, but serialize accesses
    - thread-local storage: each thread has private copy of statics
    - atomic operations: using special atomic machine instructions; lock-free

    resolves the GOT entries by OS's dynamic loader
  - procedure lookup table (PLT): used to resolve procedure call relocation
    placeholders; used alongside GOT in ELF
  - symbol visibility
    - default visibility: importing exe can override functions referenced by
      lib; useful for eg changing behavior of malloc
    - hidden/internal visibility: not visible to outside
    - protected visibility: visible to outside, but internal references use
      lib's def'n
      - slower at link time due to C requirement that ptrs to same function
        must be equal

- ld
  - `-l` order matters: dependents before dependencies (e.g. `-l` should follow
    sources)


- compilation
  - multilibs: multiple versions of libraries for different target options (for
    same general architecture)
    - eg: -m32, -msoft-float
  - `gcc -print-multi-lib`

- matlab
  - useful vectorization idioms
    - repmat(reshape())

- make
  - `:=` means immediate expansion; `=` is like function definition
  - automatically removes intermediate files at the end
    - eg, I had: `%.cpp: %.lzz`; make removed the cpp

  - signals
    - synchronous: SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, ...
    - asynchronous: SIGUSR1, ...
  - processes
    - a process that has exited, but whose parent has not called
      `wait()`/`waitpid()` on it, is a _zombie_
      - unless the parent explicitly ignores `SIGCHLD`
    - pid's can be reused, but running and zombie pid's are unique (`kill`'s
      semantics demand it)
    - pid 0: idle task, never exits; pid 1: `init` task (calls `wait`
      periodically to sweep up zombies)
    - _orphan_ processes are adopted by `init`
  - process groups
    - used to control signal distribution
    - _session_: group of groups; procs can't join/create groups in other
      sessions
      - used to implement _login sessions_
      - session leader: proc that interacts with the controlling terminal
        (shell); terminates procs on hang-up
  - exit codes
    - mod 256
    - convention: 0 = success, 1 = failure, >=128 = subprocess failure
    - 139 = seg fault = 128 + (11=sigsegv); however, bash's "Segmentation fault" is *not*
      determined by this
    - wait(2) gives you other info, eg whether program crashed (presumably bash
      uses that)
    - no way to capture shell's "Segmentation fault" message to a file, AFAIK
  - time
    - `ctime()` produces `time_t`, 32-bit seconds since 1/1/70 UTC
  - tricks
    - zygote process: a technique for being able to exec the same program
      later, even if binaries are replaced on disk
      - do this by keeping a prototype process around since startup and forking
        it when needed
      - <http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxZygote>

- terminals
  - hierarchy: each process in one process group; each group in one session
  - each session may have one controlling terminal
  - processes may open/talk to any number of terminals, but special behaviors
    for job control and access control apply only to controlling term
  - generally, all processes in a single login session or a single terminal
    emulator session are in the same session
  - each terminal has exactly 1 foreground process group; others are background
  - termios is the name of the system; while bash uses libreadline, termios
    provides the (much poorer) line editing facilities when using (eg) `cat`

- web serving architecture
  - nginx: web server, caching reverse proxy, round-robin http load balancer
    - epoll-based fork of apache 1.3; supports fastcgi; modules for eg WSGI
    - as with any async IO system, good for many concurrent (low-activity)
      connections (eg comet)
    - easier to config than apache; stable; scalable; has features
    - used by lots of high-profile sites
    - filters: gzip, ranges, chunked responses, xslt, ssi, img resizing
      - parallel ssi
    - architecture: NBIO, AIO, ...
      - master process: respawns workers, handles signals, notifies workers
      - worker: process conns
      - signals/socketpairs, shared mem
    - internals
      - graceful restarts/upgrades w zero downtime: fork & hand off sockets
        (`ngx_init_cycle`)
  - mongrel: ruby web server by zed shaw
  - god: monitors mongrel
  - unicorn: mongrel core + pull balancing (unlike load balancers)
    - all forked workers listen on same socket; leads to 'thundering herd' of
      all waking up, but a problem only when idle
  - gunicorn: Python greenlet unicorn
  - HAProxy: tcp/http load balancer; very configurable; can do smart load
    balancing; recommend in front of nginx
    - ssl, keep-alive are WIP
  - varnish: caching reverse proxy, http load balancer
    - faster than nginx?
    - uses (tons of) threads (and large addr space; designed for 64-bit)
    - already tuned by default
- web serving advice
  - setups
    - ldirectord -> varnishes -> haproxy -> nginxes
    - nginx -> haproxy -> caching -> haproxy -> app

    - heartbeat: clustering and communication layer
    - heartbeat 1: simple 2-node clustering system; manage resources running on either node
    - heartbeat 2: monolithic
    - heartbeat 3: just cluster membership; refactored cluster resource mgmt into pacemaker
      - backed by linbit; halted dev, maintenance mode now
    - pacemaker: cluster resource mgmt
      - engine is either heartbeat or corosync; corosync recommended
      - engine provides: reliable inter-node msging, consistent membership set and notifications
      - uses _resource agents_
        - LSB RAs: just LSB init scripts
        - OCF RAs: extensions of LSB RAs (eg: `monitor`, `promote`, much more)
        - legacy heartbeat RAs: same as LSB RAs but with odd `status` ops
    - openais whitetank: infrastructure + impl of SA Forum APIs (AIS standards)
    - openais wilson: SA Forum APIs only; refactored infrastructure into
      corosync
    - corosync: infrastructure refactored from openais, eg IPC/networking
      - pacemaker's preferred engine
      - also manages GFS, OCFS2 partitions
      - backed by RH, novell
    - ipvs
    - cman: redhat's clustering system; cman 1 sucked, entirely replaced by cman 2
      - cman's distributed locking implemented in-kernel; fragile
    - clvm: shares single disk among multiple boxes
      - supported clustering systems: cman, openais, corosync, gulm
      - prone to deadlocks

- python
  - greenlets
    - stackless spinoff
    - each switch = 2x memcpy, realloc, free (copying 20-100+K of mem)
    - eventlet, gevent built on this
    - doesn't work w C extensions; relies on monkey-patching
    - can't switch greenlets from C: event-loop/coroutine scheduler must be
      Python
    - violates amd64 abi
    - doesn't correctly maintain PyThreadState per greenlet, so can eg drop
      exceptions
  - coev
    - uses ucontext.h; works w C extensions; GIL = incr/decr
    - can switch from C extensions
  - WSGI
    - based on CGI; agnostic as to whether persistent/fastcgi-like or CGI-like invocations
    - synchronous; not designed for event-based IO
  - uWSGI: looks janky?

    - generally not so bad for security
    - AllowOverride Options doesn't actually enable everything
      - eg "Option SymLinksIfOwnerMatch not allowed here"
  - authentication types: basic (base64) and digest (MD5)
    - most advanced authentication backends plug into basic (pam, external)
    - basic should be used only behind SSL
    - external: uses any executable; use pwauth for crypt/pam
    - mod_authnz_external easier than mod_auth_pam, works with new apache arch,
      actively maintained, and doesn't need apache to have read access to
      /etc/shadow

- ruby
  - must require 'rubygems' first
  - #ruby-talk better than #ruby

- boost.serialization
  - binary format is quite verbose, has a lot of boilerplate overhead
    - serializing a single int takes 43 bytes; long long takes 47
  - still can't wrap my head around the "stream error" exceptions it throws
    - tricky to use stringbuf, stringstream, etc. properly
    - issues: ios_base::binary?  can't work with stringstream(string(...))?

  - _futex_: fast user-space mutex
    - single atomic instr (eg CAS)
    - kernel involved only on contention
    - TODO is this used anywhere?
  - `top`: shows 100% per core; procs exceeding this only show up as 99.9 as
    there's only so much char space

  - huge pages
    - oldest/simplest huge-page interface: shmget() with SHM_HUGETLB and

      - uses default Hugepagesize in /proc/meminfo (default_hugepagesz kernel
        param)
      - limited to shmmax sysctl param
    - HugeTLBFS: RAM-based FS; access w mmap/read; libhugetlbfs simplifies use

      - FADV_RANDOM, FADV_SEQUENTIAL, FADV_WILLNEED, FADV_DONTNEED,
        FADV_NOREUSE (access data only once; no cache)
    - for reading, madvise to create a shared buffer w system file cache is
      preferable to having reading privately with O_DIRECT, but (blind) writes
      are faster w O_DIRECT (no need to read), and also more control over
      writeback (instead of playing w mlock/munlock)
      <http://kerneltrap.org/node/7563>
    - open
      - O_DIRECT: bypass cache; doesn't imply O_SYNC
  - default stack size: 32K

- linux kernel
  - kprobes: get runtime info of any kernel routine; used by systemtap
  - systemtap: kernel instrumentation with awk-like scripts (handlers attached
    to events, eg function return)
  - perfcounters: rich abstraction over hardware counters
    - perf: user program to work with perfcounters
  - kevent/eventfs: WIP; merges socket io, network AIO, poll, inotify, timers
  - FSs: ext?, btrfs, logfs, ceph
  - kvm: great linux success story; uses qemu
  - cpuidle: governs when system enters which C states
  - set timer interrupt frequency

      CONFIG_HZ_100=y
      CONFIG_HZ=100

  - connector kernel module is useful for process monitoring; when procs die,
    kernel notifies you; you can restart, recover, etc.

      CONFIG_CONNECTOR=y
      CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS=y

  - intel xeons can offload network data coying to DMA engine with intel I/OAT
    DMA engine; see also DCA

- linkage
  - if a library contains an _init symbol or function marked with __attribute__((constructor)), it will be immediately when loaded. There's no way to "pause" the library loading, switch seccomp on, and then allow the library loading to continue. (<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1019707/sandboxing-in-linux>)


- type coercion: implicit type conversion

- dwarf: the debug info format used by gcc/gdb/etc

- sipb-mp3

- zephyr
  - You have to mkdir ~/zlog first; barnowl will not create the directory for you.
  - .anyone is your buddy list.
  - .zephyr.subs is your class/instance subscription list.
  - `znol` tells you who on your buddy list is online
    - if this gives you "znol: No such file or directory while getting
      WindowGram port" then try `zwgc -ttymode`
  - `zwrite` lets you send messages
  - when starting to send a message you'll get a ping from that person (this
    doesn't seem to show up in barnowl by default)

- proxies
  - HTTP: for web traffic; analyzes headers to determine dst; eg squid
  - SOCKS: general TCP/UDP proxy

- ssh
  - tun-based VPN: <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH_VPN>
  - ProxyCommand: the command to use to connect to the remote sshd (instead of
    plain ssh)
    - example given in man page is nc to connect via an http proxy
    - see also `corkscrew` which enables connecting via http proxy
      - not yet sure what corkscrew's value-add is

- shell scripting
  - `pidof`: Linux-specific; use `pgrep` instead

- amazon ec2
  - `ec2-api-tools`
    - `ec2-describe-images -o self -o amazon`: list AMIs owned by me or amazon
    - `ec2-add-keypair <pairname>`: create a keypair named `<pairname>` (amazon

  - rds
    - multi-az replication: synchronous to inaccessible failover; probably DRBD
    - read replicas: async replication; probably built-in mysql replication
  - ebs
    - max 100 EBS vols, max 20TB
    - no device write caching (see `hdparm -W`, `barrier=1`); all fsync's are
      durable
  - elb
    - max 5 ELBs
    - requires you to point to it via CNAME, hence root domains must eg
      http-redirect to a www subdomain that CNAMEs to it; that's a SPOF
    - only provides DNS; can't map an (elastic) IP to an ELB
  - instances
    - each inst has 2 interfaces, public and internal
    - max 20 running; max overall = 4 * max running
    - can _lock_ inst to prevent termination via mgmt console or api, only
      via cmd line
  - elastic IPs
    - takes minutes for assignment to propagate

  - cloudwatch
    - ~$10/mo/inst
    - monitors cpu, disk, network
    - autoscale
      - launch configuration: img, inst type
      - auto scaling group: launch config, AZs, min size, max size
      - trigger: measure (cpu), stat (avg), period, lo/hi thresh & scale
        increments
  - ami's
    - backed by ebs or s3; public/private/shared (ACL)/paid
    - ebs: <=1TB, <1m boot, can stop, costs more to run
      - can change kernel/ramdisk/inst-type/data when stopped
      - single command/call to create
      - snapshots stored in s3, confusingly; new ebs vol created from root
        snapshot on boot
      - by default, vols that ami boots with have DeleteOnTermination=true
      - stopping loses elastic ip
    - s3 aka instance store: <=10GB, <5m boot, can't "stop", costs less to run
      - can't change kernel/ramdisk; no 'stopping'
      - requires ami tools to create; involes "bundling"
    - creation/registration are separate steps
    - `ec2-create-image`: halt, snapshot all vols, create/reg the ami, reboot
    - kernels (aki's): only amazon/selected vendors can create
    - user selectable kernels useful for keeping inst up to date w security
      fixes & updates

- svn
  - `svn:externals`: foreign repo (fixed commit or HEAD-tracking) linked to
    from a dedicated subdir
  - vendor branches: usu. in `/vendors/`; a way to track external software
    - import files from vendor releases to its own dir, tagging the versions
    - then merge diff btwn versions into current project trunk: `svn merge
      https://repo/vendors/foo/1.{0,1}`
  - `svn log -rHEAD:1 ...`: really show all log entries; default range is
    BASE:1, which means since last svn update
  - `svn cat -r 1 https://project.com/file.txt@HEAD`: cat the file that is
    currently named `/file.txt`, but as of revision 1 (regardless of whatever
    name it had back then).  1 is the _operative revision_, and `HEAD` is the
    `peg revision`.
  - `BASE`: the revision of the working copy (local copy without modification);
    cannot be used on URLs
  - `COMMITTED`: the last revision in which the given item changed; cannot be
    used on URLs
  - `PREV`: `COMMITTED - 1`

- fences/barriers
  - mb()/barrier() in Linux kernel

- fonts
  - WOFF: repackaging of old sfnt/TrueType/OpenType format
    - gzipped TTF file + opt'l sections for XML and 'private data'
    - no need for WOFF to exist
      - TrueType has tables; opt'l sections could've been tables
      - HTTP already uses gzip
    - but having this was how the industry was able to get type foundries and
      MS on board
      - didn't want ppl using, even though trivial to convert to TTF
      - <http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/05/03/woff.html>

- css
  - designed for horizontal layout/flow layout, not vertical
  - specificity: id = 100, class = 10, else = 1; add up
  - @ rules: import, media, charset, font-face (custom fonts), page
    - <http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/atrules/>

  - css3
    - border-radius, border-image, box-shadow/text-shadow, rgba()/opacity,

    - <http://sixrevisions.com/css/css3-techniques-you-should-know/>
  - `box-sizing: border-box` (or `content-box`)
  - `word-wrap: break-word` (or `normal`)
  - columns: column-count, column-gap, column-rule, column-span, ...
  - media queries:
    - `@media all and (max-width:480px) {...}`: view narrower than 480px; no
      longer need JS adaptive fluid layout
    - `@media screen and (color) {...}`: color screens
  - combinators
    - descendant: `h1 em`; `div * p` (`p` must be grandchild or further)
    - child: `body > p`
    - adjacent sibling: `math + p`
    - general sibling: `div ~ img`
  - attribute selectors: `a[title$="tweetCC"] {...}`
  - `border-image: url(/images/border-image.png) 5 repeat`
  - `box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px #ccc` (xoff yoff blur color)
  - `text-shadow: rgba(...) 0 1px 0` (color xoff yoff blur)
  - `rgba(100, 100, 155, 0.2)`
  - `@font-face` example

      @font-face {
        font-family: 'Anivers';
        src: url('/images/Anivers.otf') format('opentype');
      }

  - horizontal align: make margin-left, margin-right `auto`
  - make elt screen-height: `height: 100%`
  - height, line-height, top/bottom margins, width (default 100%) can be set
    only for block elts
  - min-width, min-height
  - `display: none` takes up no space; `visibility: hidden` still takes space
  - pseudoclasses
    - `a`: link, visited, hover, active
    - `p:first-child`: the first `p` instance (ignore `child`)
    - `p > i:first-child`: the first `i` in any `p`
    - `q:lang(no)`: a norwegion quote (`<q lang="no">`)
    - css3: `nth-child(n)`, `nth-last-child(n)`, `last-child`, `checked`,
      `empty`, `not(s)`
  - generated content: counter-reset, counter-increment, counter(), counters()
    for nested counters (1.1.1)

      body { counter-reset: chapter; }
      h1:before {
        content: "Chapter " counter(chapter) ". ";
        counter-increment: chapter;
      }
      h1 { counter-reset: section; } ...

  - pseudoelements
    - `first-line`, `first-letter`
    - `before`, `after`: insert something before/after, eg `.x:before {
      content: "prefix: " }` or `.x:after { content: url(...png); }`
    - css3: `::selection`
  - CSS expressions: IE-only reactive property-setting
  - inheritance: eg `color` is inherited (setting on `body` will color
    everything)
  - can't vertical-align block elements like divs, floats
    - vertical-align only applies to inline elts & table cells (diff meanings)
    - until css3 advanced layout:

    - <http://csscreator.com/node/30624>
    - <http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/86031>
  - `line-height`: height of line box (note: can't be of inline box)
    - values: `normal`, `inherit`, %, float, and absolute unit measure
    - % and float are ratios of the font size
      - %: inheritance propagates calculated value, not orig %
      - float: inheritance propagates orig float, not calculated value
  - box model: blocks contain lines contain inlines
    - containing/block-level boxes: top-level
    - line boxes: height is that of tallest contained inline box
    - inline boxes: eg inline elts; everything else are anonymous inline boxes
    - content area aka em-boxes: tightly surrounds the text; set by font-size
    - _leading_: line-height - font-size
    - content area is middle-aligned in (in)line box
    - content area can be smaller than actual font size if constrained by
      containing line-height
    - <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/>
    - <http://www.slideshare.net/maxdesign/line-height>
    - <http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/inline-format.html>
  - pre-IE6 _quirks mode_ aka _box model hack_: border/padding *included* in
    width/height; unfortunately, this is arguably more intuitive, hence
    reintroduced in `box-sizing`
    - `border-box`: tells browser to behave like IE6
  - `position`:
    - `static`: the default
    - `absolute`
    - `relative` makes all children that have `position: absolute` actually
      framed in this elt's coords (origin)
    - `fixed` fixes something in place regardless of scroll pos
  - background images: `background: url(widget-image.gif) no-repeat`
  - wildcards: `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }`
  - nice header style:

      h1 {
        font-family: arial; /* or sans-serif */
        font-weight: normal;
        letter-spacing: -3px;
        text-transform: uppercase;
      }

    - useful for trying out software
    - TODO how secure is it?
  - group policy: control reg, NTFS, audit/security policy, installs,
    logons/logoffs
    - eg block taskmgr, some fs access, downloading exe's
    - group policy object (GPO): periodically pulled by clients from active
      directory
  - offline files: caching of remote files; many changes in vista
    - on reconnect, handles to open files are auto redirected to remote vers
    - efficient _bitmap differential transfer_ protocol
  - distributed file system (DFS): merge many SMB shares; in win server
  - folder redirection: a user GPO; can specify `%USERNAME%`; useful for
    network roaming; similar to `mount --bind`
  - roaming profile: requires domain controller
  - `AppData\LocalLow`: low-integrity apps like IE addons

- windows app dev
  - wow64
    - FS redir: %windir%/system32 reserved for 64-bit bins, so redir to

    - can specify `#pragma comment(lib, "PocoXXXmt.lib)` to automatically pull
      in libs
  - DLLs
    - `DisableThreadLibraryCalls()`: per-DLL optimization
      - otherwise windows calls into DLL on ea thread create/destroy

    - linker: `link`
      - eg `link app.obj ws2_32.lib`
      - if no CRT, must specify WinMain-like function with `/entry:`
    - CRT vs Windows API
      - main vs WinMain
      - compiler intrinsics: eg abs, memset are compiler-produced with pragma
        - `#pragma intrinsic(abs, memset)
    - `dumpbin`: useful disassembler and pecoff parser
  - dll search order: depends on whether safe dll search mode is enabled
    - enabled: $(dirname $0):system32:windows:.:PATH
    - disabled: $(dirname $0):.:system32:windows:PATH
  - unicode
    - `TEXT`/`_T`, `UNICODE`: for windows functions
    - `_TEXT`, `_UNICODE`: for CRT functions (`_tcslen`)
    - `MultiByteToWideChar` (ANSI/UTF-8 to UTF-16) and `WideCharToMultiByte`

        - windows-native apps: gcc, gdb, make, binutils, misc utils
    - msys: windows-native sh
  - portabel executable (PE) format
    - based on unix COFF
    - .NET exe's extend PE's
  - have just one instance of program running at a time by trying to create a
    named Monitor either under Local\ or Global\
  - can have 0-thread procs
  - processes/threads
    - priority is inherited iff parent is < normal class (below normal/idle)
    - groups: used by `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` (kinda like posix signals)
    - default stacks on 32-, 64-bit: commit 4KB, reserve 1MB
    - stack guard pages trigger commits on reserved stack space
    - limited by virt mem on 32-bit OS, commit on 64-bit OS
    - 200 KB min working set size (code + data)
  - NUMA support: processor groups

    - virt mem: _reserved_ or _committed_, _private_ or _pagefile-backed_ (shared)
      - _commit charge_: system-wide total commit
      - _commit limit_: approx. phys + swap; swap can grow
      - PF-backed must be allocated by opening handle to a Section object
      - only private can be accounted to processes
    - upper 1GB or 2GB of 4GB virt addr space is kernel
  - memory manager
    - _PFN database_: array of 28-byte structs, one per page; tracks assignments to addr spaces
    - devices are mapped into phys and virt addr space; eg gfx card can take up a lot on 32-bit systems
  - crash dumps
    - mini (64K), kernel (XP produces ~60M on 256M), full
  - system service dispatches (syscalls)
    - all go through `ntdll.dll`; `Zw*` for kernel, `Nt*` for user
    - many undocumented

          ret 2ch

    - `KeServiceDescriptorTable[Shadow]`: global syscall tables
      - KSDT is exported by ntoskrnl.exe, but not KSDTS
    - syscall nums are OS version-dependent

        DWORD * addr = (DWORD *)
          (1+(DWORD)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("ntdll.dll"),
                                   "NtCreateSection"));

    - kernel finds target addr in _thread environment block (TEB)_
      - TEB contains regs, pri, process ptr, service descriptor table (SDT)
        ptr, more
      - ie, there's a per-thread syscall table
      - SDT contains ntoskrnl and win32k system service tables (SSTs)
        - SST contains
          - system service dispatch table (SSDT): array of fn ptrs
          - always-0 field
          - number of entries in SSDT/SSPT
          - system service parameter table (SSPT): array of byte counts
        - for win32k syscall numbers, subtract 0x1000 to get offset
        - bits 12, 13 specify which of the four possible SDTs to look in
        - SDT ptr offset in TEB is also OS version-dependent

            struct SYS_SERVICE_TABLE {
              void **ServiceTable;
              unsigned long CounterTable;
              unsigned long ServiceLimit;
              void **ArgumentsTable;
            };

    - when changing, either disable write protection in cr0, or map the SSDT's
      phys addr into a new virt addr and access via that

  - debugging
    - virtual pc: use the virtual com port
      - run this on the target machine in an admin cmd; `bcdedit` is a program
        that edits boot settings, which in older systems was specified in a
        file `boot.ini`:

          bcdedit -debug on
          bcdedit -dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200

      - in the vm settings, configure the com port to map to named pipe
        `\\.\pipe\<pipe name>`

      - reboot the target

      - prepare the environment variables for windbg to be able to
        automatically fetch symbols and sources (not sure what the syntax here
        means but `\\symbols\symbols` is a microsoft-internal symbol server)

          set _NT_SOURCE_PATH=SRV*;
          set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=srv*c:\syms*\\symbols\symbols

      - connect to vm on a remote machine (same as args to kd; if local machine
        use `.` for `vpc_host_machine`):

          windbg -k com:port=\\<vpc_host_machine>\pipe\<pipe name>,pipe,resets=0,reconnect

        - `resets=0`: required for VPC; use `2` for a competing VM product
        - `reconnect`: does 2 things
          - if named pipe is not found on target, wait for it
          - if pipe disconnects, wait for reconnect

    - windbg: gui
      - used to be for user mode only while kd for kernel; now all unified into
        windbg
      - hit ctrl-break to break the target
      - commands/examples
        - `bp nt!NtReadFile`: set a breakpoint in driver `NtReadFile` of driver
          `nt`
        - `g`: continue
        - `??`: evaluate a (C++) expression
    - ntsd: cui
      - kd: doesn't exist anymore; used to be kernel debugger
    - KeBreakinBreakpoint
    - KD_DEBUGGER_ENABLED: whether system was booted with /debug
      - see also:
        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control:SystemStartOptions`
    - KD_DEBUGGER_NOT_PRESENT: whether debugger is attached
  - debug printing
    - `DbgPrint`/`KdPrint`: same as `DbgPrintEx(component=DPFLTR_DEFAULT_ID,
      level=DPFLTR_INFO_LEVEL, ...)`
    - get a component mask (dword) via windbg: `dd KD_DEFAULT_MASK` (default 0)
    - set the level to accept info: `ed KD_DEFAULT_MASK 8`

  - threads/processes
    - thread: unit of scheduling; has regs, IP, SP
    - process: >=1 thread; has handles, sec token, AS
  - threads
    - each has 2 stacks: 1 user, 1 kernel (1:1 scheduling)
    - priorities
      - 1-15: _dynamic_ priorities; kernel can boost/drop this temporarily to
        increase system tput (but never boosted to real-time)
        - boosted when it completes an IO req, waits for event/semaphore, or
          starves; also, some situations when threads in GUI or foreground
        - drivers can specify boost in `IoCompleteRequest` and `KeSetEvent`,
          `KePulseEvent`, `KeReleaseSemaphore`
      - 16-31: _real-time_ priorities; never changes
      - _base priority_: inherited from process's base priority
      - _current priority_: priority at any given time
      - kernel-mode driver running in context of user thread: base pri = pri of
        user process
    - contexts
      - permissions: eg driver routine called from user mode context can call
        `Zw*` routine in kernel context
      - for driver routines, context depends on device type, driver position in
        device stack, and other activities in system
      - eg dispatch routines run in context of requesting thread, but might
        queue IO op for processing by lower level drivers
      - some routines run in system thread context; have addr space of system
        process and security rights of OS itself
    - instead of calling `PsCreateSystemThread`, borrow a system thread from
      pool shared by all drivers
      - `IoQueueWorkItem(...IO_WORKITEM...)`
      - 3 queues: delayed, critical, hypercritical
      - run at `IRQL_PASSIVE_LEVEL`
      - using up too much time or too many workers can deadlock the system

  - interrupt request level (IRQL): distinct from x86 IRQLs
    - low to high: passive, apc, dispatch, cmc, device interrupt (dirql), pc
      profile, synch, clock, clock2, IPI, power, high
    - all threads run at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL
    - thread scheduler itself ("dispatcher") runs at DISPATCH_LEVEL
    - hence any thread running at/above DISPATCH_LEVEL has exclusive use of cpu
    - DISPATCH_LEVEL interrupts are masked off on the cpu, so thread scheduler
      is disabled / cannot schedule any other thread
      - using this you can run uninterrupted but cannot incur page faults (bc doing so requires suspending thread until swapped)
      - ISRs, DPCs run here
    - for shared memory synchronization, drivers should use a lock that raises
      the IRQL to the highest level at which any code that accesses the data
      can run

  - asynchronous procedure calls (APCs)
    - software interrupts targeted at a specific thread
    - system uses APCs to perform work in context of a particular thread, eg
      writing back the status of an IO operation to the requesting app
    - how a target thread responds to APCs depends on the thread's state and
      the type of APC

    - IO mgr creates an array of IO stack locations for each IRP
      - each driver owns one IO stack location; get with
        IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation
      - each driver responsible for calling IoGetNextIrpStackLocation to set up
        next-lower driver's IO stack location (if not passing new IRP
        altogether)
    - IoAllocateIrp creates a new IRP
      - eg used by driver to break IRP up into sub-IRPs (maybe to multiple
        other drivers)
      - alternative: reuse IRP by setting up next driver's IO stack location
      - _completion routine_
    - lowest level driver sets result status on IRP
      - on device interrupt, interrupt service routine (ISR) does min work:

          linked by next pointers)
    - memory registers
      - drivers have full access to virt addr space, but not devices

      - "Use this routine as infrequently as possible. Depending on the
        platform, KeQueryPerformanceCounter can disable system-wide interrupts
        for a minimal interval. Consequently, calling this routine frequently,
        such as in an iteration, defeats its purpose of returning very
        fine-grained, running time-stamp information. Calling this routine too
        frequently can degrade I/O performance for the calling driver and for
        the system as a whole."

general kernel hackery
======================

user_bootstrap either loads a user program ELF in `load_elf()` or, if the embedded binary's name ends with `.img`, a kernel image in `load_img()`.

Virtualization

`Processor` has a `ps_mode` specifying whether it is a VM. If it is, then `processor_arch_run()` (which is called by `processor_run()`) enters `svm_run()`.

VMs are logically stored in `vmprocessor` structs, which in turn contain a VMCB. The initialization of these things occurs in `svm_vector()` via `processor_vector()`.

The _global interrupt flag (GIF)_ is a bit that controls whether interrupts and other events can be taken by the processor; it's set and cleared by `stgi` and `clgi`.

npage: nested page
