- native command queueing (NCQ): a SATA tech that allows HD to internally
  reorder operations
  - also used in SSDs but for a reverse purpose: because the SSDs experience
    latency in the CPU; this allows for a batch of operations to be issued
  - obsoletes PATA tagged command queueing (TCQ), which was CPU intensive

Wireless NICs for Linux
=======================

work out of box:

- trendnet tew-424ub/a 3.1r (RTL8187B; version matters---see
  <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsTrendnet#USB>)

- also possibly good is medialink wireless n usb adapter
  <http://www.amazon.com/Medialink-Wireless-Adapter-802-11n-Compatible/dp/B002RM08RE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345158256&sr=8-1&keywords=medialink+usb>
  (lots of reviews, including reviews saying it works great on ubuntu)

avoid:

- sabrent usb-a11n (RTL8188CUS, 12.04 defaults to RTL8192CU)

- asus usb-n13 (RT3072, 10.04 works if correct drivers)

- trendnet tew-423pi (RTL8185L, 10.04 defaults to something else and still sees
  disconnects if correct drivers, 12.04 works)
