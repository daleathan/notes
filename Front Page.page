======================

This is my collection of notes on computer science, math, research,

The wiki has a [site-wide feed](_feed) and per-page feeds (e.g., for the
[Concurrency]() page, use [_feed/Concurrency](_feed/Concurrency)).

About
-----

I wiki-fied my notes to share them via a familiar read/write web interface.
This wiki system, [Gitit](http://gitit.net/), is powered by Git, so I've cloned
the repository [on github](https://github.com/yang/notes).
